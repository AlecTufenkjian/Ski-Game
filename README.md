Cegep Project - The Ski Challenge Game

Please [click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JdGOq9RlQLc9iWl4lHipLuOIj0OPT_DOfv3ma6mPEZg/edit?usp=sharing) to quickly view what the game looks like. Basically, a skier can move left and right with the A/D keys as his score increases with time. When the user crashes into a tree or an object, the game is over.
